# Game of Thrones

This is a project I did on IMDB ratings of Game of Thrones. I web-scraped the data from IMDB using `rvest`, then I created a dashboard using `flexdashboard`, `plotly`, `ggplot2`, and `DT`. To view my code, open the `got_dashboard.Rmd` file. To view the dashboard, click the following [link](https://rachelbellflowers.github.io/gameofthrones/).
